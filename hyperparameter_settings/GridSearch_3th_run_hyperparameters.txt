w_values = [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]
c1_values = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
c2_values = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
num_particles_values = [30, 40, 50]
num_runs = 100

changes compared to the previous grid search hyperparameters:
num_particles_values = [20, 30, 40] -> [30, 40, 50]
the increament is slowing down, so we increase the increament to 10, see how the result is
