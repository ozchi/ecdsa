w_values = [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]
c1_values = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
c2_values = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]
num_particles_values = [20, 30, 40]

changes compared to the previous grid search hyperparameters:
num_particles_values = [10, 20, 30] -> num_particles_values = [20, 30, 40]
Because there is a clear decreasing trend in the performance of the model as the number of particles increases, we want to see if the trend continues.
We change only the number of particles, so that this is a controlled experiment.
